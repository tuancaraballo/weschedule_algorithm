    "### Objective: To help test and implement algorithm that will solve monthly task problem \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At St. Francis Urgent Care center there is a need to schedule tasks on a monthly schedule and distribute tasks fairly amont the different staff members. Specificallly, if there are 20 tasks and 4 medical assistants, and each require same effort, then each should do 5 tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Important to recognize that each task:\n",
    "- has a date \n",
    "- has a weight (amount of effort) \n",
    "- may require some training\n",
    "\n",
    "Important to recognize that each staff has: \n",
    "- schedule that limits their availability\n",
    "- list of availabilities \n",
    "\n",
    "#### CSP Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem will be modeled as a CSP. We can choose to either make the variables the tasks, and domain of each variable the people who can complete the tasks, or the other way around. For simplicity of assignment, we will assign each people (domain) to tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variable: Each task (note that a task may repeat, so there will one variable for each task)\n",
    "Domain: The people who are able to complete the task will be fill this in. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### To Do:\n",
    "Make dummy MA master schedule. \n",
    "Make dummy Demand schedule \n"
